activities and collaborative learning experiences. Together, we developed a photography project where
we captured and edited images using Adobe Photoshop to build both creative and technical skills.
Since neither of us had prior experience with Photoshop, we learned together and supported each
other through the initial challenges until we both became confident in our editing abilities. This
experience allowed me to share my passion for STEM education in a meaningful, personalized way
while building a strong mentor-mentee relationship based on curiosity, mutual growth, and discovery.
